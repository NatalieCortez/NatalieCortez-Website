        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a Mexican-American woman living in California, I have the privilege of attending the University of California, Riverside. For the next two years, I will be classified as a Pre-Business major until I fulfill the necessary requirements, where I would then apply for the School of Business and study Business Administration. Through my involvement in my community, past clubs, and current employment, I have a large variety of skills that are helpful for future opportunities that may arise for me. Based on my current major, I have carefully planned out what I want my future to look like and what I would like to focus on for the remainder of my time at the University of California, Riverside.<br><br>

        At the moment, I am a full-time student at the University of California, Riverside and I am about to complete my first year. My time here has been pleasant so far, and the classes I have taken have broadened my skills and taught me new things that could help me in the workforce. Currently, I have taken Computer Science 8, Introduction to Computing, which has helped me polish my skills in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Through this class, I have gained a better understanding of these programs and where they originated from. I have proved through the labs that I would be able to use these programs for different real-life scenarios as well as for other classes. While the Computer Science 8 class has helped me with some practical computer skills, the other classes, such as my English and Math courses have helped me with some skills as well. I am currently in English 1B, Intermediate Composition, but I have also taken English 1A, Beginning Composition. Both of these classes have helped me with my analytical and writing skills through essays and group work within the class. At the moment, I have taken one math class, ARC 35, which helped me refresh my memory with Algebra. Through this class, I have been able to work based on algebra so that I could be ready to move on to the next course. In terms of broadening and perfecting my skills even further, I have plans to take more math-related classes at the University of California, Riverside as well as classes that will benefit my major.<br><br>

        I have taken classes that have helped me perfect my current skill set, but I have also involved myself in community service and clubs in the past that helped me gain skills. I have been doing community service for years, starting as early as my freshman year of high school, which has helped me gain organizational and prioritizing skills. For example, I often volunteered for events at the elementary school my little sister attended. I was also part of a variety of school organizations and clubs at my high school. For example, I was a part of La Raza, a student organization that focused on the Latino population on campus. I was also a Co-Chair for my school's Spirit Committee, where I managed the budget and planned events. From these clubs, I was able to have great leadership skills throughout high school to now.
